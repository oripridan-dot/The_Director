Project: The Director
Core Philosophy
The Director is an AI-native workflow designed to feel less like a "prompt-response" tool and more like a conversation with a brilliant, strategic partner. It prioritizes a humane, natural, and fast-feeling user experience by orchestrating a tiered system of specialized AI agents. The goal is to transform nascent ideas into sharp, actionable artifacts with maximum efficiency and insight.

The Core Experience: A Humane Flow
The problem with most LLM interactions is that they are monolithic. The user sends a prompt and waits for a single, large, and often slow response. The Director breaks this paradigm.

Our flow is designed for perceived speed and intelligence:

Instantaneous Acknowledgment (The Assistant): When a user sends a prompt, they get an immediate, near-instant response from the Director's Assistant. This might be a simple "Got it, preparing the brief for the Director..." or a quick categorization of the prompt. This confirms the system is alive and working.

Rapid Insight (The Director): The Director, a smart and fast mid-tier model, quickly reviews the Assistant's work and provides the core strategic feedback or the refined prompt. This is the "value" interaction, and it happens fast.

Considered Execution (The Expert): Only when a prompt is fully "saturated" and approved does the system engage the large, powerful, and slower "Expert" model for the heavy lifting. The user expects this step to take longer because they have been part of the refinement process that justifies its use.

Architecture: The Tiered Agents
The entire system is orchestrated by a central backend logic that routes requests to the appropriate model based on the task.

1. The Director's Assistant

Model: Ultra-fast, small model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash in a lightweight configuration).

Role: The "First Responder." Its only job is to provide an immediate, superficial analysis of the user's prompt.

Tasks:

Tokenize and categorize the prompt (e.g., "Request Type: Code Generation, Topic: Marketing").

Extract key entities or keywords.

Perform basic sentiment analysis.

Prepare a "briefing package" for The Director.

Crucially: The Assistant does not change or respond to the content. It only prepares it. This is key to its speed.

2. The Director

Model: Smart, fast, mid-tier model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro).

Role: The "Master Strategist" and the primary conversational partner for the user.

Tasks:

Reviews the Assistant's briefing and the user's original prompt.

Engages in the "Prompt Saturation" refinement loop.

Asks clarifying questions and provides strategic insights.

Decides when a prompt is "saturated" and ready for the Expert.

Summarizes the Expert's final output into a concise "Director's Cut."

Manages cross-session memory via a vector database.

3. The Expert

Model: Powerful, state-of-the-art model (e.g., Gemini Advanced).

Role: The "Deep Thinker." This model is only used for the final, heavy-lifting task.

Tasks:

Receives the final, saturated prompt from The Director.

Executes the request to the highest possible standard, generating the comprehensive final output (e.g., the full marketing plan, the complete codebase).

Development Roadmap
Phase 1: The Monolith Simulation (Current Focus)

Goal: Build the complete UI and a single-model backend to validate the user experience flow.

Frontend: A clean, three-panel interface (Chat, Director's Cut, Input).

Backend: A single API endpoint that uses one powerful model (Gemini 1.5 Pro) to simulate the roles of the Assistant, Director, and Expert based on different system prompts.

Phase 2: The Tiered Implementation

Goal: Decompose the single-model backend into the true multi-model architecture.

Tasks:

Integrate separate API calls for the fast Assistant model.

Optimize the Director's logic.

Set up the final handoff to the Expert model.

Phase 3: Memory and Grounding

Goal: Give The Director long-term memory and access to external information.

Tasks:

Integrate a local vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) for cross-session memory.

Build the "Best Practice Equalizer" module using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline with web search capabilities.
